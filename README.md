Public key infrastructure (PKI) refers to tools used to create and manage public keys for encryption, which is a common method of securing data transfers on the internet. PKI is built into all web browsers used today, and it helps secure public internet traffic. Organizations can use it to secure the communications they send back and forth internally and also to make sure connected devices can connect securely.

The most important concept associated with PKI is the cryptographic keys that are part of the encryption process and serve to authenticate different people or devices attempting to communicate with the network.

Why Is PKI Important?
PKI is crucial because the encryption and authentication it manages and makes possible ensures trustworthy, secure communication online. For an enterprise, PKI can make the difference between an intruder gaining access to the network through a connected device and keeping a potentially dangerous threat away from the organization.
